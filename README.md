Conditions Sheet
Lvl1:
     1.Write an algorithm to input two numbers and print the bigger number.
     2.Write an algorithm to check whether a number is negative, positive or zero.

Lvl2:
    1.Write an algorithm to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.

    2.Write an algorithm to check whether a number is even or odd.

     3.Write an algorithm to check whether a number is within range or not. Given two numbers that represent the range.

Lvl3:

     1.Write an algorithm to calculate a person's BMI and check whether a person is underweight, overweight, or fit. BMI is calculated using the weight divided by the height squared, where the weight in kg and height in m.
People having BMI under 18.5 are underweight, from 18.5 to 25 are fit, and over 25 are overweight. Given Height and Weight.



4. A discount is made on a purchase as follows: 
* if purchase ≤ 1000 L.E., there is no discount 
* if purchase > 1000 L.E., the discount is 5% 
Given the cost of the purchase, write an algorithm to calculate and print the money paid taking into consideration the 10% sales taxes. The taxes are calculated on the amount after the discount.

5.For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year is equal to 4 human years. Write a Python program to calculate a dogâs age in dog years, given a dogâs age in human years. Expected output should look like the following: 
* Input a dog’s age in human years: 2 The dog’s age in dog years is 21 2 
* Input a dog’s age in human years: 15 The dog’s age in dog years is 73 
* Input a dog’s age in human years: -5 Age must be positive number.


7. Write an algorithm that acts as a calculator for 2 numbers. Calculator should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Given Two Number and the sign of the arithmetic operation.

Loops

Lvl1:
1.Write an algorithm to print all natural numbers from 1 to n. 

2.Write an algorithm to print all natural numbers in reverse (from n to 3.Write an algorithm to print all the even numbers between 1 to 100. 

4.Write an algorithm to print all odd numbers between 1 to 100. 


Lvl2:
1.Write an algorithm to count the number of digits in a number.

2.Write an algorithm to find the first and last digit of a number.
3.Write an algorithm that gets two positive integer numbers X and Y and calculates x*y Use only the addition and multiplication.

4.Write an algorithm to find the least number of terms that must be added to the following series
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2+5^2
to give a sum ≥ 10000



Lvl3:


1.Write an algorithm that given two integer numbers, checks whether one number is a mirror of the other number. Hint: Use the reverse algorithm that you implemented in the previous question. Fun fact: In the Computer Science world, we call the concatenation of both numbers a Palindrome.
2. Write an algorithm that keeps on rolling two dice till both sides are equal.
3. This guessing game is a game where the program selects a random 
number between 1 and 10 and keeps asking you to guess, if you get it wrong you get a message informing you that you are a bad guesser, and then it asks you to guess again, if you guess right your program congratulates your player and exits the game loop. 
As an example assuming the program picked 6 as the secret number: 
The program prints Guess the right number: You enter 3.
 The program prints You guessed wrong XD:You enter 6.
The program prints You did it, the correct number is 6




arrys:


Lvl1:

1.Write an algorithm that reverses the order of elements of the given array.

2.Write an algorithm that inputs 10 numbers in an array using a for loop. 

3.Write an algorithm that inputs 10 numbers in an array using a while loop. 

4.Write an algorithm to print an array.


Lvl2:
1.Write an algorithm to print an array in reverse.

2. Write an algorithm to copy all elements from an array to another array.

3.Write an algorithm to find the number of occurrences of an element in an array. Given the element and the array.

4.Write an algorithm to print all negative elements in an array.

5.Write an algorithm to find the sum of all array elements.

6.Write an algorithm to find the maximum and minimum element in an array.

7.Write an algorithm to find the second largest element in an array.


8. Write an algorithm to count the total number of even and odd elements in an array.
9. Write an algorithm to count the total number of negative elements in an array.

Lvl3:


1.Write an algorithm that given an array of integers A moves all even elements in an array of integers to the front of the array and all odd elements to the rear. Hint: you do not have to maintain any order other than all events appearing before all odds in the array. For example: if the array is of the form [1,4,5,6,2,10] then the algorithm should create a new array of the form [4,6,2,10,5,1] and print the elements of the resulting array.
2.write an algorithm that sorts an array ascendingly
